# APPN Implementation
This repository is used by the APPN Central Data Team to coordinate work activities associated with building the national data network for the Australian Plant Phenomics Network (APPN).

It is used for the following:
- [Issue tracking](https://github.com/aus-plant-phenomics-network/appn-implementation/issues): High-level issue tracking for all APPN (and plant phenotyping community) data/software issues. Issues should be added to document on-going work areas, issues that need to be addressed, etc. Actual code development to implement solutions should be handled in dedicated repositories.
- [Data Handbook (Wiki)](https://github.com/aus-plant-phenomics-network/appn-implementation/wiki): Organised documentation (as it can be developed) on the models, standards, pipelines and tools under development by APPN. The intention is to provide APPN node staff and researchers with suitable information to understand APPN data management.
